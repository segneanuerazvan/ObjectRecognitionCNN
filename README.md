# Object Recognition in Images with CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform object recognition on images. The model is trained to classify objects with high accuracy using Python and TensorFlow, leveraging techniques such as data augmentation and optimization for enhanced performance.

## Features
- Preprocessing of image datasets for efficient training.
- Custom CNN architecture optimized for image classification.
- High accuracy achieved through hyperparameter tuning.
- Visualization of model performance with confusion matrices and accuracy graphs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: Framework for building and training the CNN model.
- **Keras**: High-level API for fast prototyping.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of training performance and results.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
